# A dirty implement for deep Lagrangian Net using Pytorch and Gym

A quick and dirty implementation for Deep Lagragian Network ultilizing pytorch for neural net implementation and gym for simulation platform from OpenAI. 

The implementation refers to the paper[1][2]. There might be some personal biases from my personal understanding. The final goal is to reproduce the proposed model result and implement to the simulator.
